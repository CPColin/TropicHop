<h1>TropicHop</h1>

<p>TropicHop is a game of real estate market domination set in a tropical
  island chain. Players compete with each other to travel between the various
  islands and their ports, buying and consolidating properties along the way.</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>Each player starts on {start_node} with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>{initial_cash} Tropicbux</li>
  <li>{initial_fuel} barrels of rum</li>
  <li>{initial_fuel_stations} rum stills</li>
</ul>

<p>The order in which the players play is randomized when the game starts. This
  game uses the equivalent of two {die_pips}-sided dice.</p>

<h2>The Board</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>{start_node}</dt>
  <dd>Home of the TropicHop Island Company. Players that pass
    {start_node} receive {pass_start_cash} Tropicbux from the Company.
    Players that land on {start_node} receive {land_on_start_cash} Tropicbux.
    Fuel is available on {start_node} for {fuel_price_on_start} Tropicbux per
    barrel.</dd>
  
  <dt>Ports</dt>
  <dd>Ports in the island chain can be docked at. Since traversing the surf takes energy,
    sailors must consume rum in order to continue their journey.
    Players charge each other fees for docking at ports that they
    own. Players may also place stills in order to provide rum to weary
    travelers.</dd>
  
  <dt>Black dots</dt>
  <dd>The space between islands is very dangerous. Players may never land on
    these spaces. If a
    player is circling an island and has not rolled a number high enough to pass the last
    black dot when leaving the island, the player must continue to circle.</dd>
  
  <dt>Freeports</dt>
  <dd>The Company operates several outposts throughout the island chain.
    Players that land receive a bonus from the Company.</dd>
  
  <dt>Rum Distilleries</dt>
  <dd>Rum is such a vital resource that entrepreneurs have built distilleries
    at strategic points in the island chain. Players landing at distilleries may
    be required to pay a berthing fee, but may purchase rum after doing so.</dd>
  
  <dt>Resorts</dt>
  <dd>There's always good times to be had somewhere in the tropics. Players
    can purchase controlling shares in resports and then charge other
    players bed fees when they visit. No rum is available at resorts,
    though.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Property</h2>

<p>Players may purchase ports, distilleries, and resorts that
  they dock at ({start_node} may never be purchased). Players that dock at an
  owned property must pay the owner for the privilege. The amount of money
  increases if the owner owns more properties in the same color group. It never
  costs anything for a player to dock at a property he or she owns or at a
  property that belongs to the Company.</p>

<p>Players may sell unwanted properties back to the Company
  {node_buyback_availability}. Players may sell properties to settle a debt
  owed to another player. The player receives the full price on the deed, plus
  {fuel_station_price} Tropicbux, if a still is present.</p>

<h2>Rum and Stills</h2>

<p>Players consume rum every time they leave a port and get underway. If a
  player is at a port and rolls a number higher than the number of
  barrels of rum in his or her shi, the player does not move. If the player
  is at a property owned by another player, he or she must again pay the owner
  rent for remaining at the property for an extra turn.</p>

<p>Players may refuel at ports on which a still has been
  placed or at any space dock. If the property is owned, the player pays the
  owner the price indicated on the deed per barrel of rum. If the player owns
  multiple properties of the same color, the price goes up. Refueling at a
  property that is owned by the Company is
  {fuel_available_on_unowned_node}. When allowed, the price on an unowned
  property is the lowest price listed on the deed. Players can refuel to a
  maximum of {maximum_fuel} barrels.</p>

<p>To avoid becoming stuck at a port, players may want to refuel only
  to {low_fuel} barrels, that being the greatest number that can be rolled that
  does not result in drawing a Maelstrom card. If a player with {low_fuel} or
  fewer barrels of rum docks at an owned port that lacks a still, the player
  may declare the owner negligent and purchase the property
  for the full price indicated on the deed.</p>

<p>Certain Maelstrom cards also cause the player to consume rum. If a Maelstrom
  card requires more rum than is on a player's ship, that player immediately
  loses the game.</p>

<p>Players that start a turn at a port with fewer than {minimum_fuel}
  barrels of rum may not roll the dice without first refueling to at least
  {minimum_fuel} barrels. If the player cannot refuel, he or she has become
  marooned and immediately loses the game.</p>

<p>When on {start_node}, rum is available for {fuel_price_on_start} Tropicbux
  per barrel.</p>

<p>Players may place a still on a port immediately upon
  purchasing it or on a subsequent turn. Placing a still when away from
  the intended port is {can_place_fuel_stations_on_any_node}. Once
  placed, stills never move, even when the property later changes hands.
  Stills are worth {fuel_station_price} Tropicbux at all times. They
  raise the deed price of properties, when present. They can be purchased from
  the Company {fuel_station_purchase_availability}. They can be sold
  to the Company {fuel_station_buyback_availability}. They can be
  sold to the Company to settle a debt owed to another player. They
  may never be traded between players; however, they <em>are</em> turned over
  when one player knocks another out of the game.</p>

<p>The Company has a supply of {total_fuel_stations} stills.
  Players can buy up all remaining stills in order to withhold them from
  other players. This makes it more likely that other players will run low on
  rum and possibly become marooned.</p>

<h2>Maelstrom Cards</h2>

<p>When a player rolls {red_shift_roll}, he or she does not move, but instead
  draws a Maelstrom card and follows the directions shown.</p>

<h2>Cannon Battles</h2>

<p><em>Under the current rules, cannon battles are {laser_battles_allowed}.</em></p>

<p>When allowed by the current rules, players may attack each other with
  ship-to-ship cannons. Players may attack before refueling and before rolling
  the dice or after moving, but before paying rent.</p>

<p>Players may attack ships up to {laser_battle_maximum_distance} spaces away,
  including ships on the same space as the player. Cannons take a lot of effort for sailors to man,
  and use more effort over greater distances. This consumes rum at the rate of
  {laser_battle_fuel_cost} barrels per space of distance (plus one, so
  attacking ships on the same space costs {laser_battle_fuel_cost} barrels).
  Players can fire at multiple ships on the same space at once for no
  additional rum cost.</p>

<p>During an attack, the attacker rolls the dice. If the attacker rolls
  doubles, the shot has hit and damaged the target ship(s). Each player that
  suffers damage must pay the attacker {laser_battle_damage_cost} Tropicbux for
  each pip on the dice. If the attacker rolls double {die_pips}, the expertly
  targeted cannon <em>destroys the ship(s) that it hits</em>. The players,
  without their ships, immediately surrender their possessions to the attacker
  and are out of the game. If the attacker does not roll doubles, the shot
  misses with no ill effects and play continues.</p>

<p>Attacking from {start_node} is {lasers_can_fire_from_start}. Attacking a
  player who is on {start_node} is {lasers_can_fire_at_start}.</p>

<h2>Bypassing</h2>

<p><em>Under the current rules, bypassing is {bypass_allowed}.</em></p>

<p>When allowed by the current rules, rolling doubles allows the player to have
  the option of bypassing having to dock, instead rolling and moving
  again, unless the player is required to draw a Maelstrom card. When rolling
  doubles, the player collects {bypass_cash} Tropicbux, then moves and uses rum
  as normal. After moving, the player can either dock as normal or roll
  again without having to pay any rent or fees. The second roll costs the
  player no rum. Players may not bypass spaces between islands. When allowed by the
  current rules, players may fire cannons while bypassing.</p>

<h2>Winning the Game</h2>

<p>The last player standing is the winner. Alternately, players can agree on a
  time limit. In time limit games, the player with the greatest net worth is
  the winner.</p>

<h2>Losing the Game</h2>

<p>Players can be eliminated from the game in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Declaring bankruptcy when faced with an insurmountable debt.</li>
  <li>Becoming marooned by attempting to roll the dice while at a port
    with fewer than {minimum_fuel} barrels of rum.</li>
  <li>Drawing a Maelstrom card that requires the use of more rum than the
    player has available.</li>
  <li>Being destroyed by an expertly targeted cannon shot, in games where cannon
    battles are allowed.</li>
</ul>

<p>When declaring bankruptcy or being destroyed by cannon, everything the player
  owned becomes the property of the creditor or the attacker. When running out
  of rum, everything the player owned becomes the property of the Company.
  All stills that were placed on properties remain where they are.</p>
